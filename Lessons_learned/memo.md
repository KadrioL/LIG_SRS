So as you can see we have some key points in the first category of things we wanna introduce next time in a project, and we have only one point in the middle category, which is things we wanna stop doing like that. In this case it is the delayed finishing of tasks. The last category is about things we liked doing the way we did. There are some key points about task management and dividing it to different persons. But all in all it was very good in our points and we are happy to share you the results.
